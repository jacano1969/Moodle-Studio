THE TINY (BOOTSTRAP) PROJECT: A work in progress

------------------------------------

Tiny, is a fluid width, fully responsive, Moodle theme built using Twitter Bootstrap 2.0 with a basic grid scafolding layout, which is based on 960 Grid System (960.gs), and combined with javascript plugins, typography, form controls, and more.

Tiny is, however, only intended as a starting point for other themes to build upon.

It is not recommend to use this theme on a production site!

I almost forgot, I added some new pix core and plugin icons.

---------------------------------------

Fixed a few more issues with respect to the layout which was casuing problems with the responsive design. All seems to be working well now.

---------------------------------------

Finally fixed vanishing blocks thanks to John Stabinger who spotted it was a CSS issue and not Javascript as I had imagined.
Added more customization in the shape of @font-face css which use Custom settings to call the fonts. I have added two free fonts to test it with.
I also added some more renderers so I could style the buttons.
I'm quite pleased with it now as it's beginning to take shape at last.


UPDATE: 30 September 2012

Added more customization.
