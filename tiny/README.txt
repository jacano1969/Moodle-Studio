THE TINY PROJECT: A work in progress
------------------------------------

Tiny, is a fluid width, fully responsive, Moodle theme built using Twitter Bootstrap 2.0 with a basic grid scafolding layout, which is based on 960 Grid System (960.gs), and combined with javascript plugins, typography, form controls, and more.

Tiny is, however, only intended as a starting point for other themes to build upon.

It is not recommend to use this theme on a production site!
